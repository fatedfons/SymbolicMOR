# Phase 3 - Parallelized Snapshot Generation

"""
    generate_snapshots_parallel(f!, u0_ensemble, tspan; kwargs...)

Parallel version of generate_snapshots. Distributes ODE solves across
all available workers using @distributed.

# Usage
Before calling this, ensure workers are added:
    using Distributed
    addprocs(4)
    @everywhere using LiftAndLearnMOR

Then:
    X = generate_snapshots_parallel(lorenz!, u0s, (0.0, 10.0))

The speedup should scale approximately linearly with the number of workers
for large ensembles (communication overhead is minimal since each job
returns a matrix and trajectories are independent).
